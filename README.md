# TaskBrew
**Task Brew Task Organizer**<br>
This project was created by Jared Fitton and Jake Trimble for the 36 hour UCSB hackathon. We built a weekly sprint style task manager to help students organize tasks across classes.

While this version still has some bugs, it is a good foundation that illustrates what we were looking to achieve.
